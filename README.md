# **Workshop: Product Liability and Open Source Hardware**

**Speakers:** Greta Sparzynski and Tarmio Emanuel Sathya Frei

## **Overview**

This repository provides the slide deck *“Product Liability for Open-Source Hardware – Implications of the New EU Product Liability Framework”*. The presentation explains how the updated EU Product Liability Directive (2024) and the German Product Liability Act affect the development, publication, and commercial use of Open Source Hardware (OSH).

Participants learn how product liability applies to digital design files, software, 3D models, and hardware components, and how the distinction between commercial and non-commercial activity determines liability exposure.

## **Topics Covered**

* **Liability Frameworks**

* **Definition of a “Product”**

* **Defects and Risk**

* **Commercial Activity**

* **Actors Potentially Liable**

* **Open Source Exception**

## **Learning Outcomes**

Participants understand:

* When OSH designs, software, or files become “products” under the new Directive
* How liability shifts between designers, manufacturers, integrators, and platforms
* Which activities trigger commercial liability
* How OSH communities can structure distribution to mitigate risk
